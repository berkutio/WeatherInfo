# WeatherInfo
Opensource application for obtaining weather forecast based on device GPS coordinates. Application architectures implements MVP approach.
Using one network request only helps better understand MVP feathres as well as it's testing ability.
Further plans:
1. Implementing dependency injection with Dagger2 library
2. Implementing RxAndroid
3. Showing differences between MVP and MVVM desigh patterns with databinding.
